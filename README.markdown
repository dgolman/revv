# Revv Technical Challenge

This repository contains the bare-bones example Stripe Connect application plus my additions to match the requirements for the Revv Technical Challenge

## Pre-requisites

Login to Main Stripe:
	Email: revvtechchallenge@gmail.com
	Password: revvdonate

## Testing

### Step 1

View products

### Step 2

- Add, edit and delete products from the store
- View all the products that are currently being sold on the store
- View details about a specific product, and purchase that product

### Step 3

After making a purchase you will be redirected back to the home page with link embeded in the flash message for you to view your charge on the seller's account.

## Aside

Seller's account is created within my application using Standalone OAUTH. This can be viewed at [https://sheltered-oasis-34225.herokuapp.com/users](https://sheltered-oasis-34225.herokuapp.com/users)
